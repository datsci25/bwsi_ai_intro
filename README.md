AI introductory projects

1) **AI intro project - Classifier Models (Logistic Regression and KNN - Digits dataset (11/15/25)**
   Learned K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
   Learned Logistic Regression Classfier
   Tools/Libraries/techniques : sklearn, deepnote, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, image recognition, train/test split techniques, confusion matrix review, KNN-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, etc
   Model training, model.fit (to appply a model to a prediction)
   KNN: Adjust K from 3 to 5 improved the model accuracy from 96% to 99%
   Logistic Regression: tried changing the train/test split from 80/20 to 70/30 and reviewed the accuracy
2) **Continuation of AI intro project - Classifier Models (Logistic Regression and KNN - Digits dataset (11/19/25)**
   Experimented with various k values (such as 2)
   Changed train/test split from original 80/20 to 90/10 to observe how accuracy was affected
   Accuracy increased to 98.33%
